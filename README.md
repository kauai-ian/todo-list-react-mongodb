# React Todo List with MongoDB database

Attempted a simple todo list using React.

- It has the ability to have seperate lists of todo items.
- Each todo item can be checked and unchecked.
- The checked items can all be cleared from the list using the clear completed button.
- Individual lists and todo items can be removed using the delete button (trash can icon).
- Upon page refresh, the lists and todo items are still there due to connection to MongoDB on the backend.
