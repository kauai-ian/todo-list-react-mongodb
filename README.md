# React Todo List with MongoDB database

Attempted a simple todo list using React. 
* It has the ability to have seperate lists of todo items. 
* Each todo item can be checked and unchecked. 
* The checked items can all be cleared from the list using the clear completed button.
* Individual lists and todo items can be removed using the delete button (trash can icon).
* Upon page refresh, the lists and todo items are still there due to local storage in browser. 
* The default list of Inbox cannot be deleted. All new todos default to inbox unless another list is actively selected.
